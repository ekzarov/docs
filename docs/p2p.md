## Peer-to-peer systems
A peer-to-peer system (often abbreviated as p2p) is a system in which parties interact directly with each other without having to go through a middleman. 

Peer-to-peer systems have three key characteristics:

* **No middlemen needed**:
One of the key characteristics of peer-to-peer systems is that middlemen are not always required, though they are allowed. So for example when I book a hotel room with a travel agent I am going through a middleman but if I book a hotel room directly with the hotel then that is direct communication, we are communicating on a peer-to-peer basis.
* **Direct links**
In order for there to be direct communication between both parties, there has to be direct links between them.
* **Direct interaction**
It is not enough just for parties to be able to communicate directly, they have to be able to actually interact. Peer-to-peer systems are characterized by direct interaction, for example actually making a booking with the hotel sending back a booking confirmation.

## Positive characteristics

There are two important positive features about peer-to-peer systems:
1.  **Aligns with decentralized systems**;
Peer-to-peer systems align closely with decentralized systems, both require trust between parties in order to work effectively and both do not require central authorities to manage the system. Peer-to-peer communication is the basis of how parties in decentralized systems interact with each other.
2. **More freedom** 
By not having to go through a middleman it gives users more freedom. They are not limited by the information for example provided by the hotel booking site but can find out far more by being in direct contact with the hotel and likewise the hotel can ask questions directly to their guests.

## Limitations

The main negative feature about peer-to-peer systems is that often there are useful services that middlemen provide that individual participants may find hard to provide themselves, such as balancing the market. Also middlemen often provide useful marketing and promotion services.

## Examples

One of the most popular uses of peer-to-peer systems have been file sharing networks which allow members to directly share files with each other. These have come under a great deal of scrutiny with numerous lawsuits as the lack of a central authority has resulted in the inability to enforce copyright legislation, and numerous copyright infringements have been alleged.

A perhaps more successful use for peer-to-peer systems has been in the area of Cryptocurrencies. Currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, Nxt, and Peercoin are peer-to-peer-based digital cryptocurrencies.
